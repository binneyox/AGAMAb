/** return one or more pseudo-random numbers in the range [0,1), seeded by the input values.
    The purpose of this function is to produce a predictable but well-mixed output --
    if it is called with the same input, it will always produce the same result,
    but a difference even in a single bit will likely produce very different result.
    It can be used in a dynamically load-balanced multi-threaded context, such as orbit
    integration, when one needs a stream of pseudo-random numbers which doesn't depend on
    the thread index, only on some input data, and one can provide an input entropy source.
    The output of this function can be used as optional input for several routines below,
    which generate random numbers with specific distributions from the input values
    uniformly distributed in [0,1).
    \tparam      K is the number of input floating-point values (acceptable range: 1 to 6);
    \param[in]   seed is the array of K floating-point numbers, whose bitwise representations
    will be used as the entropy source, to seed the PRNG;
    \param[in]   N is the number of output random values;
    \param[out]  output  is the pre-allocated array to store N pseudo-random numbers.
    Construct the initial state of a PRNG from the provided input bitstream.
    \param[in]  data  is the array with some data serving as the source of 'entropy'
    \param[in]  len   is the length of input array, measured in 8-byte chunks (could be float, int, ...)
    \param[in]  seed  additional source of bits, essentially augmenting the input array by 1 element.
    \return  well-scrambled hash of input data, which can be used with any of the above random... routines
