/** Parameters that describe an interpolated distribution function.
    It is represented on a 3d grid in scaled coordinates in the action space,
    where the first variable corresponds to the total action (sum of three actions)
    with a logarithmic transformation:  x = log(1 + (Jr+Jz+|Jphi|) / J0),
    and the other two variables range from 0 to 1 and determine the ratio between actions.
    The array of amplitudes defines the value of interpolated DF;
    in the case of linear interpolation, the amplitudes correspond to the values of DF at grid nodes,
    but in the case of cubic interpolation there is no straightforward correspondence between them;
    moreover, in the latter case the number of components (elements in the amplitudes array)
    is larger than the number of nodes in the 3d grid.
