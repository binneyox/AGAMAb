/** Estimate the (largest) Lyapunov exponent from the time series of the (log) of deviation vector 'w'
    computed along the orbit.
    If the orbit is regular, |w| grows at most linearly with time, whereas if it is chaotic,
    then eventually |w| starts to grow exponentially, after some initial 'hidden' period.
    We keep track of the running average of |w|/t, and when it exceeds some threshold,
    this is taken to be the transition to the exponential growth regime.
    From that point on, we collect the average of ln(|w|)/t as a proxy for the Lyapunov exponent,
    and return the value normalized to the characteristic time (orbital period).
    If no such transition was detected, then the return value is zero.
    \param[in]  logDeviationVector  is the array of collected values of ln(|w|) during orbit integration;
    \param[in]  samplingInterval  is the time between consecutive values;
    \param[in]  orbitalPeriod  is the characteristic time of the orbit, needed both to define
    a suitable interval for the running average of ln(|w|), because it exhibits large fluctuations
    over the timescale of orbital period, and for normalizing the output value of the Lyapunov exponent
    to the characteristic orbital time (it may then be taken as a direct measure of chaoticity -
    values around unity indicate strongly chaotic orbits, and much less than unity - weakly chaotic).
    \return  the estimate of the normalized Lyapunov exponent, or zero if the orbit seems to be regular.

/** Runtime function that monitors the evolution of the deviation vector along the orbit,
    and estimates the [largest] Lyapunov exponent, which is an indicator of chaos.

    The 6d deviation vector w = {Dx, Dv} measures the distance between the orbit and another
    infinitesimally close neighbor orbit, and its evolution is described by the variational equation:
    \f$  d[Dx(t)] / dt =       Dv(t) + Omega \times Dx(t)  \f$,
    \f$  d[Dv(t)] / dt = -H(t) Dx(t) + Omega \times Dv(t)  \f$,
    where Omega is the pattern speed of the potential, and
    \f$  H_{ik}(t) = d^2\Phi[ x(t) ] / dx_i dx_k  \f$  is the Hessian of the potential,
    evaluated at the time-dependent point along the orbit.
    Hence the evolution of the deviation vector is described by a linear ODE with time-dependent
    coefficients, which are themselves functions of the original orbit.

    We have two alternative approaches for numerical solution of the deviation equation:
    - incorporate it together with the equations for the orbit itself into one ODE system with
    12 variables, and evolve it using the standard ODE solver;
    - follow the 6d orbit itself with the standard ODE solver, and use another specialized ODE solver
    for the variational equation, feeding it with the potential derivatives computed along the original
    orbit.
    The first approach is straightforward, but has a disadvantage that the original ODE system
    is modified (hence orbits computed with or without the variational equation will be different).
    In particular, it typically leads to shorter timesteps and hence longer integration time.
    The second approach, by contrast, is transparent for the orbit integrator, but requires a few more
    potential evaluations per timestep to compute the Hessian; in the present implementation,
    it transforms the 6d variational equation into three second-order ODEs, but this is not possible
    in a rotating frame.
    Both approaches are implemented in this class, the choice is controlled by the template parameter.
    When using the first approach, the orbit integrator must also be changed to `OrbitIntegratorVarEq`
    or a similar one providing the variational equation for the second half of the 12d solution vector.

    \tparam  UseInternalVarEqSolver determines the approach for dealing with variational equation:
    if false, it must be solved by the orbit integrator (providing a 12d solution vector),
    if true,  an internal ODE integrator for the var.eq. is used with any orbit integrator.
