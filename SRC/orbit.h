    \brief   Orbit integration
    \author  Eugene Vasiliev
    \date    2009-2017

    This module provides classes and routines for numerical computation of orbits in a given potential.
    This task is divided between three classes:
    - a generic ODE integrator;
    - the function that provides the r.h.s. of the ODE (time derivatives of position and velocity 
    in a particular coordinate system) for the given potential, optionally with some figure rotation;
    - functions that perform useful data collection tasks on the orbit while it is being computed.

    The first part is implemented by one of the available methods from math_ode.h,
    and the instance of an appropriate class derived from `math::BaseOdeSolver` is
    constructed internally for each orbit.
    The second part is implemented by any class derived from `math::IOdeSystem`, and this module
    provides such classes (`orbit::OrbitIntegrator`) for the three standard coordinate systems
    with time-independent potentials, which however may have a nonzero pattern speed.
    The third part is realized through a generic system of 'runtime functions', which are attached
    to the orbit and called after each timestep of the ODE integrator, so that they can access
    the trajectory at any point within the current timestep (obtain the interpolated solution)
    and use it to collect and store any relevant data. For instance, the `orbit::RuntimeTrajectory`
    class stores the trajectory at regular intervals in the appropriate coordinate system.
    The `orbit::integrate()` function binds together these constituents and computes the orbit
    starting with given initial conditions for a given interval of time, taking an arbitrary number
    of runtime functions; another convenience function `orbit::integrateTraj()` performs a simplified
    task of just recording the trajectory.

    and in the latter case, whether the position/velocity has been modified by the function).
    There may be several such functions that are invoked sequentially;
    they may maintain their own internal state or accumulate some information
    during the orbit integration (the relevant method is non-const),
